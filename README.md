# HiLight

### VSCode extension for highlighting a selected range(s) from a file. <br>

<br>

### NOTE:<br>

I just thought having such a feature would be useful when navigating between <br> multiple (big) files for whatever reasons, mostly debugging.i So I made this. <br>
You can find it under the name of `HiLight` on vscode extensions marketplace.
<br>

## Use Your Own Colors

To customize HiLighting color and other properties, you can go and add your own configs to `settings.json` <br>
Open vscode command palette (SHIFT + CMD + P) type `settings json`
