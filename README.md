# HiLight

### VSCode extension for highlighting a selected range(s) from a file.
<br>

### NOTE:

I just thought having such a feature would be useful when navigating between <br> multiple (big) files for whatever reasons, mostly debugging. So I made this. <br>
You can find it under the name of `HiLight` on vscode extensions marketplace.
